/////////////////////

v1.2
	- A lot of minor improvements.
	- Fix small bugs.
v1.1
	- Do not worry about duplicates when saving the meshes combined in your project file!
	- If you have saved the merge files in your project files, and you want to undo the merge,
	  all unnecessary files are also deleted from your project. So you do not worry about memory problems!
	- The combined mesh manager now shows you a warning if it detects that one of the meshes combined
	  does not have any important files.
	- The documentation has been contemplated with the new details!
v1.0
	- The Easy Mesh Combiner has just been released! I will always be working to support and add new features!
	  Do you have any suggestions, Bug reports or any problems with using this asset? Contact by email!
